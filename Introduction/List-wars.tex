\subsection{List of wars America was involved with}
Since the second World War, America has been involved in four War operations~\autocite{va-gov-american-wars}.
The Korean war, Vietnam war, Operation Desert Storm, which is also known as the Gulf War~\autocite{defense-gov-gulf}, and the Global War on Terror~\autocite{va-gov-american-wars}.

In these four wars the US committed a bunch of war crimes, ~\autocite{globalpolicy-iraq-warcrimes}~\autocite{historynews-vietnam-warcrimes}~\autocite{hrw-hr-abuses-afghanistan}~\autocite{washingtonpost-korea-warcrimes} the most common one being massacres of unarmed civilians.~\autocite{asiasociety-nogun-ri}~\autocite{history-my-lai}~\autocite{theguardian-shinwar-shooting} The US made no efforts in cooperating with human rights organizations or the International Criminal Court, effectively commending any war crimes US soldiers committed~\autocite{globaltimes-us-evade-warcrimes}.
