\subsection{List of wars America was involved with}
Since the second World War, America has been involved in four War operations~\cite{va-gov-american-wars}.
The Korean war~\cite{va-gov-american-wars}, Vietnam war~\cite{va-gov-american-wars}, Operation Desert Storm~\cite{va-gov-american-wars}, which is also known as the Gulf War~\cite{defense-gov-gulf}, and the Global War on Terror~\cite{va-gov-american-wars}.

In these four wars the US committed a bunch of war crimes ~\cite{globalpolicy-iraq-warcrimes}~\cite{historynews-vietnam-warcrimes}~\cite{hrw-hr-abuses-afghanistan}~\cite{washingtonpost-korea-warcrimes}, the most common one being massacres of unarmed civilians~\cite{asiasociety-nogun-ri}~\cite{history-my-lai}~\cite{theguardian-shinwar-shooting}. The US made no efforts in cooperating with human rights organizations or the International Criminal Court, effectively commending any war crimes committed~\cite{globaltimes-us-evade-warcrimes}.
