\subsection{The Global War on Terror}
The Global War on Terror began after the Terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on the 11th September 2001, George W. Bush, who was the acting President at this time, announced that the US was creating a plan to locate and stop Terrorists all around the world~\autocite{gowt-bushlibrary}. In connection to these announcements the US first started a war in 2001 with Afghanistan and then in 2003 in Iraq~\autocite{gowt-bushlibrary}, these wars are part of the Global War on Terror, however the Global War on Terror also describes non-violent actions taken against the financing of Terrorist groups.
The invasion of Iraq began on the 20th March 2003~\autocite{cfr-iraq-war} with US air strikes, the invasion was justified with the Global War on Terror and Iraq's ownership of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.~\autocite{britannica-iraq-war}. The first stage of the war ended a month after the first air strikes with the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime on the 1st May 2003~\autocite{cfr-iraq-war}. 

The war however continues with the hunt for Saddam Hussein, who was captured on the 14th December 2003 and executed 3 years later on the 30th December 2006~\autocite{cfr-iraq-war}. During this time the battle in Iraq continues after Shiites won the 2005 election~\autocite{cfr-iraq-war}.
Even though the war went on until 2011, the Bush Administration admitted on the 24th January 2004 that no biological, chemical or nuclear weapons were found in Iraq, as the former US weapons inspector David Kay told the congress: "we were almost all wrong"~\autocite{cnn-david-kay-senate-hearing}.

This then begs the question, if it was already known that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction in 2004, why did the US continue the war until 2011, what are the real reasons for the war?
