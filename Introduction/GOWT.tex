\subsection{The Global War on Terror}
The Global War on Terror began after the Terrorist attack on the 11th September 2001, George W. Bush, who was the President during this time, announced that the US was creating a plan to locate and stop Terrorists all around the world~\cite{gowt-bushlibrary}. In connection to these announcements the US started wars in Iraq and Afghanistan~\cite{gowt-bushlibrary}, these wars are part of the Global War on Terror, however the Global War on Terror also describes non-violent actions taken against the financing of Terrorist groups.
The invasion of Iraq, began on the 20th March 2023~\cite{cfr-iraq-war} with US air strikes, the invasion was justified with the Global War on Terror and Iraq's ownership of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.~\cite{britannica-iraq-war}. The first stage of the war ended a month after the first air strikes with the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime on the 1st May 2003~\cite{cfr-iraq-war}. 

The war however continues with the hunt for Saddam Hussein, who was captured on the 14th December 2003 and executed on the 30th December 2003~\cite{cfr-iraq-war}. During this time the battle in Iraq continues after Shiites won the 2005 election~\cite{cfr-iraq-war}.
Even though the war went on until 2011, the Bush Administration admitted on the 24th January 2004 that no biological, chemical or nuclear weapons were found in Iraq, as the former US weapons inspector David Kay told the congress: "we were almost all wrong"~\cite{cnn-david-kay-senate-hearing}.

This then begs the question, what the actual reasons for the War was, if was shown that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction.
