\subsection{The purpose of this Term Paper}
At the time of writing this, war is starting to become a more important topic again, with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022~\autocite{bbc-invasion-ukraine}, increasing complications between China and Taiwan~\autocite{bbc-china-taiwan}, as well as the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the following takeover from the Taliban~\autocite{cfr-afghanistan}.

In the western world, people usually take a side with the US or other western countries and see them as the "good guys", however people often fail to see the background of wars and completely ignore the fact that  wars are not for the "Liberation of a country"~\autocite{george-bush-liberation-iraq}, but for the profit of those, who win the war. Which, due to the NATO mainly consisting of Western countries and being \emph{the} strongest Military force, is guaranteed to be them~\autocite{nato-strongest-force}.
With this Term paper I want to show that there are no "good guys" in a war, only "better guys" at best.

The reason I chose the United States for this is simple, they are the strongest force in the NATO~\autocite{statista-nato-aircraft-strength}, which results in them having the most influence in NATO decisions. If I want to show the reasons for wars, then America will be the best example since other NATO countries follow America in a lot of military decisions.

But it should also be noted that America is not the only country guilty of starting wars because of money, every war is in some way caused by money, no matter if the war was started by America, Russia, China or any other country. Every war is a crime on humanity and an example as to why Capitalism is a horrible economic structure.
