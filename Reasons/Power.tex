\subsection{Power in other countries}
Most wars which involve gaining power in other countries are not military wars, but economic wars. The US in this case often sets embargoes on countries that do not follow them in their decisions, like with Cuba, Venezuela or a lot of countries in the Middle East~\autocite{us-treasury-embargoes}.
\subsubsection{Cuba}
The US embargo against Cuba started with the Cuban Revolution in which Fidel Castro took over the Cuban Government, even though the currently acting US President Dwight D. Eisenhower officially recognized the new Cuban Government as legitimate, relations rapidly started to deteriorate after Fidel Castro began nationalizing more companies and started the agrarian reforms, in which the Government broke up large landholding and redistributed them to the people who work on that land and the state. With each state take-over of privately owned land the US embargo rose in strength, up to the point where any trade with Cuba was prohibited for US Companies. This embargo also got extended to the point where the US threatened any non-US based company with sanctions if they were doing trade with Cuba~\autocite{cfr-us-cuba-relations}. The US opposition to the Cuban government under Fidel Castro even went as far as the CIA attempting to assassinate Fidel Castro over 600 times~\autocite{cnn-fidel-castro-assassination}.

\subsubsection{Israel} % the funnies start here :D   update: it was not the funnies D:
Israel is a very controversial topic in international politics, which also makes it a prime reason for wars. The controversy stems from the fact that Israel lies on land stolen from the Palestinian population~\autocite{aljazeera-israel-illegal-settlement}.
During the second world war, Palestine was controlled by the British, due to the holocaust in Europe a lot of Jewish people immigrated into Palestine, under supervision by the British. They formed their own villages, also called kibbutzim, and were not interested in forming any Jewish State. After the British retreated from Palestine, Zionist groups started attacking Palestinians with the goal of starting a Jewish State. The UN tried to settle these attacks with the 1947 Partition Plan, which would split Palestine into two parts and assign one half to the Zionists. Palestine openly expressed their dissatisfaction this plan as it would illegally steal part of their country, while the Zionists seemingly agreed with it~\autocite{aljazeera-israel-illegal-settlement}.
After the Partition Plan was completed and Palestine was split into Palestine and Israel, Zionists started attacking the Palestinian land and claimed it for themselves, causing Palestinians to flee into other Arabic countries like Jordan or Lebanon~\autocite{aljazeera-israel-illegal-settlement}. 
Even though Palestine is an occupied territory, Israel continues to send their population into these territories and apply Israeli law, which directly violates the fourth Geneva Convention. Despite this, countries still acknowledged the new Israeli territory as a legitimate part of Israel~\autocite{aljazeera-israel-illegal-settlement}.

With Israel being a country with western ties in the middle east, the US had an interest in forming good ties with Israel in order to have a proxy in the middle east. This has been the case with the Iran-Israeli Proxy conflict, in which Iran threatened to dissolve Israel and give the land back to the Palestinian people. And now is a proxy war involving Syria, Lebanon, Russia, the United States, the United kingdom and Saudi Arabia~\autocite{aljazeera-israel-iran-shadow}~\autocite{smh-shadow-war-israel-iran}~\autocite{lemonde-shadow-war-israel-iran}~\autocite{time-shadow-war-israel-iran}.
