\subsection{Communism}
Communism as a cause of war is an interesting topic, the US has not started any wars against communism ever since the cold war, yet Communism and Socialism is still an important topic in modern foreign policies and even internal policies, with the rise of Communism and Socialism among Millenials and Gen-Z~\cite{theguardian-genz-capitalism}, it becomes a more broadly discussed topic in politics, with the majority of politicians, not being very happy, as they are a prime target of Communist and Anarchist movements, such as Antifa protests.

As a reaction to this, the US tries to silence any Communist politicians or countries, be it through direct wars, secret CIA operations or the influence of media to spread false information~\cite{theguardian-anti-communist-usa}. Secret CIA operations include assassinations of Communist leaders, like the Communist leader of Cuba Fidel Castro, who survived over 600 murder attempts from the CIA and ended up dying naturally at the age of 90 in Havana on the 25th November 2016~\cite{cnn-fidel-castro-assassination}.

The war against communism however is not always violent. During the cold war and the Red Scare, the US also made a huge effort to keep people away from Communistic believes through state propaganda.
This propaganda was usually spread through movies, literature, music, television and art. It would usually mock the soviet union and communism through misinformation. The US Government however did not display it as propaganda and insisted that everything shown was factually correct.
