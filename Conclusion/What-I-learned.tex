\subsection{What I learned from this Term Paper}
The core information of this was nothing new to me, however the extend of what the US does to justify their wars and war crimes was very shocking and only made my hate towards the US worse.
To know that there are some people who are able to commit genocide without any issues just because they own a lot of paper which has a man-made value attached it.
I also have to retract a statement I made in the beginning of this Term Paper, there are no "better guys" in wars. Everyone who participates in any war is a horrible person and it does not matter what their political opinion is. They all commit genocide towards groups of people and point at the others saying that they are the ones violating human rights, while secretly having a genocide against transgender people in their own country and murdering children in a state based on stolen land.
This system of gaining power through money and gaining money through power it is only a matter of time until every country turns into some sort of Fascist state.
