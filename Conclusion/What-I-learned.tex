\subsection{What I learned from this Term Paper}
The core information of this was nothing new to me, however the extend of what the US does to justify their wars and war crimes was very shocking and only increased my critical attitude towards US politics.
This Term Paper showed me, that countries are able to ignore war crimes through and lie to the population in order to make them seem better to retract a statement, which also is the reason why I want to retract a statement I made in the beginning of this Term Paper, I said that there are only "better guys" in wars, not "good" guys, after writing this Paper it has become clear to me that even "better guys" do not exist in wars. Everyone who participates in any war is a horrible person and it does not matter what their political opinion is. They all commit genocide towards groups of people and point at the others saying that they are the ones violating human rights, while leading a genocide against transgender people in their own country and secretly murdering children in a state based on stolen land.
I have also noticed that Imperialism is not dead, as many assume. Imperialism never ended, except that now the government knows how to hide their Imperialism and sell it to the population as a "Liberation", "removal of Nazis" or "fighting terrorist groups".
Due to this system of gaining power through money and gaining money through power it is only a matter of time until every country turns into some sort of fascist, imperialist state.
