\subsection{What to take from this Term Paper}
In the end, what to take from this Term Paper is the choice of the Reader, however I hope that this Term Paper cleared up that there are no good reasons for War. Even if countries tell us that their War is for the "removal of Nazis" or for the "liberation" of a country, it is never the Case. Every War always boils down to the gain of power or money, although nowadays these things are the same.

The war for Oil results in a shift of power in OPEC, which allows the most powerful country to influence the international Oil price. Due to this easy way of gaining a monopoly, a state can abuse their position in OPEC very easily.

The war against Communism has the goal of defeating an idea that goes against everything the US stands for since it tries to abolish the entire concept of a class based society, meaning the Government any rich people would loose their power.

And finally, the attempts of gaining power in countries. This, as the name already suggests, gives power in a country. But it is not always this easy, as seen with the example of Cuba, getting power over countries can also mean completely blocking any cooperation with specific states, in this case setting an embargo on Cuba and threatening non US companies of sanctions if they decide to trade with Cuba gives the US control over every company that is interested in having the US as a partner, which usually every company wants.
